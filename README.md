# Driver-Drowsiness-Detector
Built a Driver Drowsiness Detector that takes input from live video feed to study the driver's face every instant and predicts the driver is drowsy when the driverâ€™s eyes are closed for quite long or when he/she yawns, and raises an alarm.
- Used HOG feature descriptor and pre-trained dlib library for detection of driver's face.
